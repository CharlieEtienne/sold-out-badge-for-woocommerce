== Description ==

Display a "Sold Out!" badge on out of stock products.
When a WooCommerce product becomes out of stock, this plugin will show a badge on thumbnail with the text you will have defined.

This plugin was initially created to help people and companies selling *unique* products or services, like artists, artisans, real estate professionals, etc. It is often beneficial for them to keep showing sold out (out of stock) products on their websites, while displaying a message indicating that the product can't be sold anymore.

However, this plugin can be used by **anyone** wanting to display **any text** in a badge when a product is out of stock.
