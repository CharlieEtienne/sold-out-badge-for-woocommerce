Display a "Sold Out!" badge on out-of-stock products.
Show the text and colors you want. Perfect for artists, artisans, real estate professionals...

== Description ==

Display a "Sold Out!" badge on out-of-stock products.
When a WooCommerce product becomes out of stock, this plugin will show a badge on thumbnail with the text you will have defined.

This plugin was initially created to help people and companies selling *unique* products or services, like artists, artisans, real estate professionals, etc. It is often beneficial for them to keep showing sold out (out of stock) products on their websites, while displaying a message indicating that the product can't be sold anymore.

However, this plugin can be used by **anyone** wanting to display **any text** in a badge when a product is out of stock.

It is also possible to display a badge on backorder products.

== Usage & Documentation ==

You can customize options in ***Settings > Sold Out Badge for WooCommerce***

= What can I customize in this plugin ? =

== Installation ==

1. Install this plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. That's it. You're ready to go! Please, refer to the Usage & Documentation section for examples and how-to information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin completely free? =
Yes.

= Can I use this plugin for commercial purposes? =
Sure, go ahead! It is completely open source.

= Can I change the badge text? =
Yes. Go to *Settings > Sold Out Badge for WooCommerce*, you'll find the setting you want.

= What if this plugin isn't compatible with my theme or doesn't work? =
You could uninstall this plugin and try to get the badge manually. There are two ways you could do it:

**1. Pure CSS**

If you're lucky enough, you'll have a specific CSS class for out-of-stock products.
You could add a SOLD OUT badge like this:

~~~css
.product.outofstock:before {
     content: 'SOLD OUT';
     color: #ffffff;
     background: #FE2121;
     font-size: 16px;
     padding: 4px;
     font-weight: bold;
     width: auto;
     height: auto;
     border-radius: 0;
     z-index: 9999;
     text-align: center;
     position: absolute;
     top: 6px;
     right: auto;
     bottom: auto;
     left: 6px;
}
~~~

**2. PHP + CSS**

Otherwise, you could use WP hooks to add a badge. Put this code in your child theme's `functions.php`:

~~~php
add_action( 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop_item_title', 'my_custom_soldout_badge_display', 10 );
add_action( 'woocommerce_before_single_product_summary', 'my_custom_soldout_badge_display', 30 );

function my_custom_soldout_badge_display() {
    global $post, $product;

    if ( ! $product->is_in_stock() ) {
        echo '<span class="wcsob_soldout">SOLD OUT</span>';
    }
}
~~~

Use the following CSS code to style the badge:

~~~css
.wcsob_soldout {
     content: 'SOLD OUT';
     color: #ffffff;
     background: #FE2121;
     font-size: 16px;
     padding: 4px;
     font-weight: bold;
     width: auto;
     height: auto;
     border-radius: 0;
     z-index: 9999;
     text-align: center;
     position: absolute;
     top: 6px;
     right: auto;
     bottom: auto;
     left: 6px;
}
~~~
